The `first two phases` refer to the `exercises inside the Master notebooks` of the [DM2025-Lab2-Exercise Repo](https://github.com/difersalest/DM2025-Lab2-Exercise.git). The `third phase` refers to an `internal Kaggle competition` that we are gonna run among all the Data Mining students. Together they add up to `100 points` of your grade. There are also some `bonus points` to be gained if you complete `extra exercises` in the lab **(bonus 15 pts)** and in the `Kaggle Competition report` **(bonus 5 pts)**.\n",

    "- **Phase 2 exercises:** We use Gemini's API so everything can be run with only CPU without a problem.\n",
    "- **Phase 3 exercises:** For the competition you will probably need GPU to train your models, so it is recommended to use Colab or Kaggle if you don't have a laptop with a dedicated GPU.\n",

    "### 2.1 Mention Different Things You Tried\n",
    "At the beginning of the project, we encountered several challenges in correctly loading and parsing the raw data. The primary data source, final_posts.json, had a deeply nested structure that was not immediately obvious. Our initial attempts to load the file using standard pd.read_json() or a simple json.load() produced a DataFrame with only one column ('root') containing lists or dictionaries, which made it impossible to access the actual post IDs and text content.\n",
    "This failed to extract usable fields. Only after inspecting the raw structure manually did we realize that each post was stored under the path post['root']['_source']['post'].\n",
    "\n",
    "Once data loading was resolved, we initially planned to use traditional text representation methods such as TF-IDF with n-grams and Logistic Regression or SVM—standard baselines for text classification. While these approaches are efficient and interpretable, preliminary experiments showed limited performance, likely because social media text is short, noisy, and rich in emotional nuance that word-based models struggle to capture.\n",
    "\n",
    "To address this, we shifted toward semantic embeddings using Google’s text-embedding-004 model via the Google Generative AI API. \n",
    "\n",
    "I  also experimented with:\n",
    "- Text cleaning strategies (removing URLs, normalizing user mentions and hashtags),\n",
    "- Stratified train/validation splits to preserve class distribution,\n",
    "- Caching embeddings to avoid repeated API calls during development.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ultimately, the embedding-based pipeline proved both robust and effective, forming the basis of our final submission.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.2 Mention Insights You Gained\n",
    "Through this process, we gained several key insights:\n",
    "1. Data structure matters: Even with clean code, misunderstanding the JSON schema can lead to silent failures (e.g., empty or misaligned features). Always inspect raw data before modeling.\n",
    "2. Semantic embeddings outperform traditional methods for emotion detection in informal text. While TF-IDF works well on formal, topic-driven documents, it lacks the contextual awareness needed to distinguish subtle emotional cues in short social media posts."
